vimesMulti
==========

*vimesMulti* is a package for detecting disease outbreak clusters from temporal and spatial suveillance data using group-specific epidemiological parameters.

Infectious disease epidemiological parameters such as serial interval, transmission distance and reporting probabilities may vary between groups. For example. reporting probabilities may be higher for children than adults. 
vimesMulti uses a simulation approach to incorporate these differences in group-specific epidemiological parameters during outbreak cluster detection. It is an extension to the existing *vimes* package which uses a graph-based method for outbreak cluster detection.
